# 🧠 Working with Open-Source LLMs - Deepseek

Welcome! 👋
This repo is my personal learning journey into **LLM (Large Language Model) engineering**.
It’s beginner-to-intermediate friendly, and I’m using this space to experiment, break things, and (hopefully) understand how open-source models work.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

* Jupyter Notebook: `working_with_open_source_models_part_two.ipynb`
* Topics covered so far:

  * ✅ Connecting to a local LLM server (Ollama)
  * ✅ Making API calls with Python (`requests`)
  * ✅ Working with **system prompts**, **user prompts**, and **messages**
  * ✅ Simple **web scraping** with BeautifulSoup
  * ✅ Cleaning and extracting website text for model input

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Requests** (HTTP requests)
* **BeautifulSoup** (web scraping)
* **Ollama** (local LLM serving)

---

## 📚 Why I Made This

I’m currently learning how to:

* Build and run **chatbots** using open-source models
* Understand how prompts work (system vs user vs assistant)
* Automate tasks like scraping and feeding data into models

This repo is not “production ready” — it’s more like a **lab notebook**. If you’re learning too, you might find it helpful.

## 🤝 Contributing

I’m still learning, so feedback, corrections, or even just suggestions are super welcome.
Open an issue, drop a PR, or just say hi.

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

* The open-source AI community 💜
* [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) for making local models easy to run
* [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for HTML parsing magic

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run

Clone the repo and open the notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
jupyter notebook working_with_open_source_models_part_two.ipynb
```

Make sure you have Python and Jupyter installed.

## 🌱 Next Steps

* Clean up my code (make it more modular)
* Try different open-source models
* Experiment with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
* Build a simple chatbot interface
